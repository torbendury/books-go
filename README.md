## 👷 Usage

### 🏃 Running

After installing dependencies using `go get`, you should be able to run the project with `go run cmd/main.go`. The server will start up and be reachable at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

See [`test.http`](hack/test.http) for available API endpoints.

If you want to use PostgreSQL as a backend and don't have any at hand, you can use the [docker-compose](hack/docker-compose.yml) file to spin one up.

**NOTE:** The DB init scripts only run on the first time. To run them again and effectively clean up your database, you will want to prune the docker volumes after a shutdown. See also [notes](hack/NOTES.md).

## ✔️ TODOs

See [TODO](TODO).

## 📷 Generating puml

Run: `go-plantuml generate -d . -r`
